# Deno Proxy Server

This is a version of the proxy server written with TypeScript, using Deno for the runtime.

The server will listen on port 3001.

## Usage

### Pre-compiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries for Linux and Windows are provided in the `/bin` directory. If you don't have the Deno runtime installed, or want to get up and running faster, use these.

### Dockerfile

There is also a provided Dockerfile that will allow you to build a Docker image for easier usage on a server.
